**Description:** Starfield Citadels is a strategy-based, action-packed game, which aims to give the user an enjoyable experience alongside with stunning visual effects. This game is fueled by a desire to create a unique, creative, strategy-packed game with limited manpower. The main issue we address in this game is how to quickly and efficiently render many graphical elements in quick succession with little to no lag and no over-consumption of memory. In order to accomplish this, the game uses Open GL ES to communicate with the processor to be able to perform actions as quickly as possible. The development of the game is encompassed in 6 main sections: Storyline, Game Engine, Interfaces, Gameplay, Graphics, and Sounds.

https://github.com/NullProductions/StarfieldCitadels/tree/master/Classes

The majority of the files we will be working with will be in this folder but since this is an android project there will also be other folders you will want to take a look at. Namely this one, https://github.com/NullProductions/StarfieldCitadels/tree/master/Resources, as it will contain all of our graphics and other android settings.
